# CodeCamp 2019 sessions

This year, I will be giving two talks:

- [Not your Daddy's Docker 101](./Docker101.md)
  > Just about every Docker 101 out there starts with how to run things, spinning up processes, and progresses into other neat things it can do. We may start with running a container, but instead of moving forward, we will move backward to the basics and explain how things are connected, how you can know what will happen, how to know what went wrong, and how to know exactly what the heck is going on.
  > As an added bonus, we will review exactly what went into each layer of your docker image.
  > Session backed by 100% money back guarantee
